# Introduction to Django Development Environment Setup

Welcome to the **LibraryProject**! This repository is your go-to resource for setting up a Django development environment and kickstarting your journey into Django development.

In this project, you'll gain hands-on experience by:

- Installing Django
- Creating a new Django project
- Running the development server
- Exploring the project structure

## üéØ **Objective**

```
### **3. Run the Development Server**

Navigate into your project directory:

```
cd LibraryProject
```

Then, start the development server:
