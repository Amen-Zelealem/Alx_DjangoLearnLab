## Filtering, Searching, and Ordering

The following features are available on the `/api/books/` endpoint:

### Filtering:
- You can filter books by the following fields:
  - `title`: Filter by book title.
  - `author`: Filter by book author.
  - `publication_year`: Filter by the year the book was published.

Example:GET /api/books/?title=Book Title&author=Author Name&publication_year=2022

### Searching:
- You can search for books by `title` or `author`.

Example:GET /api/books/?search=book


### Ordering:
- You can order the results by `title` or `publication_year`.

Example:GET /api/books/?ordering=title

We can also combine filtering, searching, and ordering in a single query:

GET /api/books/?author=Author Name&search=book&ordering=publication_year
